            <h3>ADVANCED AERODYNAMIC SHAPING</h3>
            <p>A seamless aerodynamic design features a raised skirt, a more symmetrical shape, and streamlined edges to reduce drag for faster clubhead speed.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>PWR-BRIDGE WEIGHTING</h3>
            <p>An innovative suspended bridge weight design enables unrestricted flexibility of the face and sole, and positions the CG low and forward to unleash faster ball speed.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>PWRSHELL WITH H.O.T FACE</h3>
            <p>A forged PWRSHELL face insert maximizes flexibility for faster ball speed and higher launch. A H.O.T Face design uses artificial intelligence to create a variable thickness pattern that delivers more efficient speed and spin across the face.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>CARBON CROWN AND SOLE</h3>
            <p>A carbon fiber crown and sole create a lighter and stronger chassis and allow more weight to be positioned low in the clubhead for added stability.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>ADJUSTABLE LOFT</h3>
            <p>An adjustable loft sleeve offers fine tuning of trajectory and spin. Each loft is adjustable up to +/- 1.5 from the printed loft on the head.</p>
